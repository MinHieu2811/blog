# Welcome to MDX Blog ðŸŽ‰

This is a sample blog post to test our **MDX** setup.
We're using **Shiki** for syntax highlighting, and custom components for `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `code`, and more.

## Subheading Example

Here is an example of a paragraph. This is where you write content and include formatting like **bold**, *italic*, and ~~strikethrough~~.

### Unordered List

- Next.js is awesome ðŸš€
- MDX makes writing blogs fun!
- Prisma + Supabase for database management

### Ordered List

1. Install dependencies
2. Setup Next.js with MDX
3. Fetch content from Supabase Storage
4. Render using `next-mdx-remote`

## Code Block Example

Hereâ€™s a **TypeScript** example:

```tsx
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`;
}

console.log(greet("Developer"));
